Intro:
	Finally, the golem is energized...
	Within this cave lie the ruins of an ancient alchemy lab.
	The ruins contain a philosopher's stone capable of transmuting anything imaginable.
	Try not to die while fetching it for me.

If the player stays in the first room too long:
	Don't make me wait, golem...

Tutorial Notes:
Basic jump:
	I must jump onto the ledge to reach the Master's treasure...
Don't touch the water:
	If I fall into the water, I'll never be able to reach the Master's treasure...

The rune door:
	These runes aren't energized, but Master's treasure is behind the door.
	My own earth enegy will energize the earth rune, but I'll need to find something to energize the others...
	I must find the Master's treasure...

Eventual revelation-inducing notes:
First:
	That trap almost knocked me into the water.
	I must not fail Master...

Second:
	I must break through that rotting door.
	I need to find Master's treasure...

Third:
	I must destroy that ancient golem standing guard.
	The Master's treasure must be near...

After the stone:
	The stone...
	It transformed me...
	I've become a person, like Master...
	I need to bring this to Master, he'll be very pleased.

Before the skeletons:
	Without the elemental energy I controlled as a golem,
	I will not be able to return to Master the same way I came...

On one of the skeletons:
	There are so many of them, did Master send them all?

On several skeletons:	
	Master will never get his treasure now...
	I have failed him...
